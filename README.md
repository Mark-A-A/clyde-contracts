**Notes:**
  - Given colors are merely illustrative, feel free to use whatever colors you want!
  - Where heights and widths are given, use them. Where they are not, sizes are up to you.


### Node Exercise
  - Setup: run `npm test` in the root folder. The tests will watch the pertinent files and re-run as necessary.
  - Your goal is to make each test pass, either by editing the test or the function it's testing.
  - Please read the instructions for each test as different tests may have different rules.

**Notes:**
  - We recommend working with the two files side-by-side, but feel free to work however makes you most comfortable.
